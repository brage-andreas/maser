# Maser
A Discord bot made with discord.js version 13.

## How to deploy commands
1. Fill `CLIENT_ID` and/or `GUILD_ID` keys in `.env` file.
	If no `GUILD_ID` is present, it will deploy commands globally.
2. Run `npm run build` or `npm run clear`

## Notable features
* Loggers, both in console and in Discord
* Hide option on all commands
* Manager classes make tasks easy to do
* Private — only logs successful actions
* Good command UI and UX
